    <description>[Jack] leads you on, being careful not to get too far ahead of you.
Jack: "I heard the howls of wolves last night coming from these woods.
I haven't seen Joss since supper yesterday.  I've been looking
for a sign, but nothing seems to point to where he might be.  Perhaps
a witcher like you could (check) out the surrounding and find a clue."

To (check) something out, type "check" followed by the name of the thing
you want to (check) and hit ENTER.</description>

    <onTalk>Jack: "Don't look at me!  I've been searching for a sign all day."</onTalk>
