Jack: "I heard the howls of wolves two nights ago coming from these woods.
I haven't seen Joss since that afternoon.  I've been looking for a sign,
but nothing seems to point to where he might be.  Perhaps a witcher like you
could (check) out the surroundings and find a clue."

To (check) something out, type "check" followed by the name of the thing
you want to (check) and hit ENTER.

To (check) the [bushes], type "check bushes" and hit ENTER.</description>
