    <description>Though rotting and rarely trod, the [bridge] has seen use of late.
One who recently crossed this way let fall a thin [book],
which now rests in the middle of the bridge.</description>
    <onCheck>The cover has a hand-written title: Joss's Survival Guide.
Most of its pages have been torn out.  One of the remaining pages reads:
"To see what items you are carrying with you, type "inventory" and hit ENTER."</onCheck>
