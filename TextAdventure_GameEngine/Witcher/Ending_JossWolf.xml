  <description>The witch screams in agony and perishes.  Flames spew from the cauldron.
The entire hut begins to burn.  Orange and green fires rush to the very roots of the hill.
You stomp the front door and its wooden planks splinter and fly into the night.
You sprint away from the inferno and back to the village, [Joss] stumbling behind you,
the [wolf] at his side.</description>

    <description>At the edge of town, a blue [portal] shines behind a small, dark figure.</description>
    <onCheck>Dawn is coming soon, but the portal reminds you of dusk.

Geralt: "I hate portals.  They make my stomach churn."</onCheck>

    <onTalk>Jack: "Joss!  You are safe!  The White Wolf has slain the witch."

Joss: "The grey wolf and the White Wolf have saved me."

Jack: "Glad am I to hear that, but did either save your mother?
For a beast drag her from the edge of town this night.
She was dragged deep into the forest where that pyre now burns."

Geralt: "Could that have been the woman beyond the red gate?"

Joss: "No one can survive that burning!  And all to spare this [wolf]."

Jack: "This [portal] will not send you far away from this fate, but will
instead give you a chance to avoid it.  (Go) through the [portal] if you
would not carry this death on your shoulders for the rest of your days."</onTalk>
