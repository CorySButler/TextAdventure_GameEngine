  <description>The witch screams in agony and perishes.  Flames spew from the cauldron.
The entire hut begins to burn.  Orange and green fires rush to the very roots of the hill.
You stomp the front door and its wooden planks splinter and fly into the night.
You sprint away from the inferno and back to the village, [Joss] stumbling behind you.</description>

  <hint>Geralt: "What a shame!  Better give this another shot."</hint>

    <description>At the edge of town, a blue [portal] shines behind a small, dark figure.</description>
    <onCheck>Dawn is coming soon, but the portal reminds you of dusk.

Geralt: "I hate portals.  They make my stomach churn."</onCheck>

    <description>[Joss] stops before the figure.</description>
    <onCheck>He is out of breath.</onCheck>
    <onTalk>Jack: "Joss!  You are safe!  The White Wolf has slain the witch."

Joss: "In that I take but little cheer.  He has also slain my dear protect."

Jack: "Say not your 'dear protect' was your dear mother!  For a beast drag her
from the edge of town this night."

Geralt: "Of course I did not slay his mother.  Where did they go?"

Jack: "She was dragged deep into the forest where that pyre now burns."

Joss: "She was the woman beyond the red gate!  No one can survive that burning.
My protector and my mother you have taken from me."

Jack: "This [portal] will not send you far away from your misdeeds, but will
instead give you a chance to atone for them.  (Go) through the [portal] if you
would not carry these deaths on your shoulders for the rest of your days."</onTalk>
