  <description>You approach the light.  It is a torch fastened to the cave wall.
A gnarled, grey hand snatches it up and extinguishes it.  Deep, cackling howls
roar up the throat of the cave.  The other children's screams are drowned out by
wicked laughter.  Numerous cold hands with long fingers and hooked claws grasp your limbs
and cover your mouth.  The stench of unclean beasts overcomes you.  You grow dizzy and faint.

A clash of steel and a gurgling shout awaken you. You are in a tight, dank room.</description>
