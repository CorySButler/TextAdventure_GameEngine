  <description>The witch screams in agony and perishes.  Flames spew from the cauldron.
The entire hut begins to burn.  Orange and green fires rush to the very roots of the hill.
You stomp the front door and its wooden planks splinter and fly into the night.
You sprint away from the inferno and back to the village, [Joss] stumbling behind you,
his [mother] draw over his shoulder.</description>

    <onCheck>Dawn is coming soon, but the portal reminds you of dusk.

Joss's mother: "Is well, or will be after some rest.  The White Wolf has slain the witch."
