    <description>The boy is indeed [Joss].  He has grown much in the past few years.</description>
    <onCheck>His sour attitude seems diminished.  The terror of the [nekker]
and the support of the [wolf] may have caused a change in him.</onCheck>
    <onTalk>Joss: "Can it be you?  First this grey [wolf] and now the White Wolf come to my aid!  I am Joss,
and I beg you to forgive me for my misleading words I spoke to you at our last meeting.
I have been shaken to my core, and have grown because of it."

Geralt: "Good.  So you can give me the truth, and all the truth.  Are you alone down here?"

Joss: "I have this [wolf] with me.  I followed him and his mate to the clearing in the woods.
I thought they would kill me when they finally spotted me, but then that monster appeared from
the hut and chased us down here.  A can't tell you how many days ago that was."

Geralt: "What can you tell me?"

Joss: "That the wolves hated the monster more than they hated me.  And that this is a witch's hut!  That monster
obeys her and watches us.  She killed the second wolf tonight to open the [gate].  She threw some poor woman in there.
I covered my face when the witch came, but I think the woman my have come from my own village."

Geralt: "A sacrifice to open the [gate], huh?"

Joss: "I suppose, but you mustn't hurt this [wolf].  He has saved my life."</onTalk>
