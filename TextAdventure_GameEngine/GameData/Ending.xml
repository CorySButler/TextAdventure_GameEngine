  <description>The witch screams in agony and perishes.  Flames spew from the cauldron. The entire hut begins to burn.  Orange and green fires rush to the very roots of the hill. You stomp the front door and its wooden planks splinter and fly into the night. You sprint away from the inferno and back to the village.</description>

    <description>At the edge of town, a blue #portal^ shines behind a small, dark figure.</description>
    <onCheck>Dawn is coming soon, but the portal reminds you of dusk.

Geralt: "I hate portals.  They make my stomach churn."</onCheck>

    <description>It is the figure of a boy.  #Jack^ is quivering before the portal. Jack: "I see you are weary, but we must @talk^."</description>
    <onCheck>He looks horrified.</onCheck>
    <onTalk>Jack: "Geralt, where is Joss?  You did not leave him behind, did you? No one can survive that burning.  The White Wolf has slain a witch but cursed a young man to death in return.  This #portal^ will not send you far away from your misdeeds, but will instead give you a chance to atone for them.  @Go^ through the #portal^ if you would not carry Joss's death on your shoulders for the rest of your days."</onTalk>
